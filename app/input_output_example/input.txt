# This is the input file for the program.
#
# It contains the six side lengths of the tetrahedron, which, when given the
# labels of {0, 1, 2, 3}, are written in the order:
#   r01  r02  r03  r12  r13  r23
#
# This example, of using an input file to write out the side lengths, and having
# the output written to `output.txt`, is provided for compliance with the
# requirements for publishing PESs in the Journal of Chemical Physics. 
#
# The model can also be used through Python directly, without the use of an input
# file.
# 
# The input side lengths are in units of angstroms, and the output energy is in
# units of wavenumbers.
